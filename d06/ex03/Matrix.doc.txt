<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class handles matrix which is a 3D representation on a 4x4 array. This implementation represents the 2D array as a 1D array.

An instance can be constructed from an array with preset.
$I = new Matrix( array( 'preset' => Matrix::IDENTITY ) );

We can also pass in vertices and other parameters.

The class provides the following method that perform calculations :

float magnitude() : returns the vectorâ€™s length (or "norm").

Vector normalize() : returns a normalized version of the vector. If the vector is
already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.

Matrix mult( Matrix $rhs ) : returns the multiplication of both matrices.

Vertex transformVertex( Vertex $vtx ) : returns a new vertex resulting from
the transformation of the vertex by the matrix.
